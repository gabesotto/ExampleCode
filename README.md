ExampleCode
===========

Some simple code examples to show C, C++, Java, and C socket programming coding styles.
In order of complexity from most to least:

---Sliding Window--- (C)
A go-back-n sliding window protocol implemenation using sockets in C.
Both a client and a server can be run on any IP and port and transfers
a small file (100KB or less) relibably using UDP.

---Asteroid Simulation--- (Java)
A java program that simulates asteroids striking the surface of a planet
until saturation equalibrium is reached.

---Polygon--- (C++)
A program that takes in a polygon as a graph and checks to see if the 
graph is a polygon, and also if that polygon is convex or concave.

---MergeSort--- (C++)
A simple sorting program that implements a recursive merge sort.

---Graph--- (C++)
A simple C++ class that represents a graph class through an adjacency
matrix.
